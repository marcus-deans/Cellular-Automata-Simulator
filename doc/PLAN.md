## User Interface

Here is our intended UI which we drew out for Game of Life. We included the 'parameters' field to
show what values would appear like, even though Game of Life has no parameters. In this case the
parameters label would be present but the field would be empty. For illustrative purposes, potential
parameters for a Fire game were included in the image.
